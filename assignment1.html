    <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    <p> IT in business has been able to help us communicate better between employees and customers. 
        Early on it, there was less equipment available as most of it back in the day cost big amounts to buy and run.
        Slowly over the next few years, the internet started to get faster but was still quite slow and unreliable. 
        In today's standards we are a society that is always connected with access to high-speed internet in most places
        and it also quite cheap to own personal systems that are able to communicate on the go. Because of this businesses 
        have been able to become a lot more cost efficient due to them having more tools to work with such as marketing products online.
        The ability to view banking in real time with a clear overview of how much a company spending and making benefits them greatly as 
        they are able to plan better. </p>
    <h2>1.2Describing methods, skills, and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
    <p> Nowadays there is a wide range of tools available to help businesses manage projects. There are tons of dedicated software for all 
        aspects of daily work that helps with planning, managing and keeping on top of information. The most basic standard programs are ones
        that help with monitoring, presenting projects, word processing, and spreadsheet analysis. This results in the business to become more successful.

    <h2>1.4 </h2>
    <p> Some of the biggest risk that impact digital projects are time and cost. There can be lots of cost risks that have to be considered
        carefully before implementing such as what kind of hardware is going to be used for your project. Having a good schedule and keeping 
        on top of time management can reduce risks of work stacking up and can result in additional cost and delay of the project. Another risk 
        is the performance, a project might fail if it doesn't produce consistent results for the project. One of the biggest things to consider 
        would also be legal risks. If you have all of these workings and checked over you would drastically reduce the risks that come when working 
        on a digital project.</p>
    <h2>1.5</h2>
    <p>Technology encompasses a wide variety of options on what to use for what type of job. The important thing is finding the perfect fit for what 
        you specifically need for your project. There have been rapid advances in cloud services, Artificial intelligence, data management and IT services 
        which can have an impact on what you want to choose for your project. Allot of them might be great with what you want to do but might not be necessary 
        to implement thus saving you time by knowing what you are trying to accomplish and what you are going to use to create your project. Some of the question 
        you would want to ask yourself about your project would be what type of hardware and software you want to use. Consider what type of storage you would 
        be using whether it be hardware or cloud-based storage and what problems that can create. How and what data will be stored. There tons of factors that 
        affect a project and you should consider as many as you can before going ahead on the project.</p>
    <h2>1.6 </h2>
    <p>For my project, I'm using a combination of Trello and GitHub to keep on top of my files and tasks. I use Trello make cards that show me what tasks need 
        to be completed, I'm doing and which ones I have completed. I also use it to throw references up that I want to use later on my page. It is a useful tool 
        as it helps me with staying on top of the work I need to complete every day. So the first thing I do is check where I'm up to and drag something into my 
        “Doing” tab. From there I try and complete it in the given time and check it off on my Trello. This just means I don't have to constantly think about where
        I'm up to what I'm doing and what I should be working on, it visualizes my work for me so I can constantly see where my work is up to. GitHub I use to keep 
        track of my code, files and project versions. Whenever I make a change in my code and I want to update my page I would have to update all the content in GitHub
        by using Terminal to upload any changes I have done. After that, I can check my page online to see the changes in place.

    <p>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. GDPR applies to any organisation operating within the EU, as well as any organisations outside of the EU which
         offer goods or services to customers or businesses in the EU. GDPR is what is used to standardised data protection laws. It increases privacy and extends data rights
          for EU citizens. These represent issues that need to be considered with all projects as they impact it greatly.</p>
    <h2>2.1 </h2>
    <p>I have been using a wide range of IT tools to help me complete this project. For information organization i have been using Trello and updating it whenever i complete a 
        task and start another one. I use Slack to get in contact with anyone if i need to or if i want to send files to others. Apart from that for text editing i use Google 
        Documents and Google Slides which are very helpful as they save your documents to the cloud and you can always access them from anywhere with your email. All of these
         programs and services have been super helpful in helping me stay on top of my project and i have been very satisfied with them and would use them again for future projects.</p>
