            <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
            <p> 
            In business I.T. is able to help people communicate effecitly between employees and customers. 
            Early on, there were fewer technologies available as most of it used to cost much more to run.
            As time passed the internet started to get faster, however still remained quite slow and unreliable. 
            In today's standards we are a society that is always connected with access to high-speed internet in most places
            and it is also quite cheap to own personal systems that are able to communicate on the go. Because of this businesses 
            has been able to become a lot more cost efficient due to them having more tools to work with such as marketing products online.
            The ability to view banking in real time with a clear overview of how much a company spending and making benefits them greatly as 
            they are able to plan better. In this day and age nearly everyone in the UK owns a device that they can access the internet with. 
            The purpose of IT in modern business helps us have a large amount of data that we can access at any point with lots of tools and 
            programs that enable us to complete a wide variety of tasks.

            <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills, and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h2>
            <p> Nowadays there is a wide range of tools available to help businesses manage projects. There are tons of dedicated software for all 
            aspects of daily work that helps with planning, managing and keeping on top of information. The most basic standard programs are ones
            that help with monitoring, presenting projects, word processing, and spreadsheet analysis. This results in the business to become more successful.</p>

            <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2>
            <p>To plan my webpage I will be using Trello to have an overview of what tasks I am currently working on and what tasks I have completed. 
            Trello is an extremly effecient tool as it will allow me to keep on top of the submission deadline. For the design of the page, I did a few sketches 
            and drawings to help me have an idea of how the finished page is going to look. I also did some initial steps in setting up a GitHub 
            repository ready for when I start writing my code.</p>

            <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects</h2>
            <p> Some of the major risks that impact digital projects are time and cost. There can be lots of cost risks that have to be considered
            carefully before implementing -- for example; what kind of hardware will be used for your project? Keeping a good schedule and having
            great time management can reduce risks of work stacking up and can result in additional cost and delay of the project. Another risk, 
            is the performance -- a project might fail if it does not produce consistent results. One of the biggest things to consider 
            would also be legal risks. If you have all of these working and checked you will drastically reduce the risks that come when working 
            on a digital project.</p>

            <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software, how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
            <p>Technology encompasses a wide variety of options on what to use for what type of job. The important thing is finding the perfect fit for what 
            you specifically need for your project. There have been rapid advances in cloud services, Artificial intelligence, data management and IT services 
            which can have an impact on what you want to choose for your project. Allot of them might be great with what you want to do but might not be necessary 
            to implement thus saving you time by knowing what you are trying to accomplish and what you are going to use to create your project. Some of the question 
            you would want to ask yourself about your project would be what type of hardware and software you want to use. Consider what type of storage you would 
            be using whether it be hardware or cloud-based storage and what problems that can create. How and what data will be stored. There tons of factors that 
            affect a project and you should consider as many as you can before going ahead on the project. You can find a huge amount of information on anything 
            if you know how to search for things using Google. There are huge databases dedicated to lots of topics and this includes HTML and CSS practices 
            and how to apply them.</p>

            <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes.</h2>
            <p>For my project, I'm using a combination of Trello and GitHub to keep on top of my files and tasks. I use Trello make cards that show me what tasks need 
            to be completed, I'm doing and which ones I have completed. I also use it to throw references up that I want to use later on my page. It is a useful tool 
            as it helps me with staying on top of the work I need to complete every day. So the first thing I do is check where I'm up to and drag something into my 
            “Doing” tab. From there I try and complete it in the given time and check it off on my Trello. This just means I don't have to constantly think about where
            I'm up to what I'm doing and what I should be working on, it visualizes my work for me so I can constantly see where my work is up to. GitHub I use to keep 
            track of my code, files and project versions. Whenever I make a change in my code and I want to update my page I would have to update all the content in GitHub
            by using Terminal to upload any changes I have done. After that, I can check my page online to see the changes in place. Online resources such W3 Schools has 
            helped med find specific HTML and CSS that i want to use and it shows you exactly how you woul dinclude it in your code. Using VSCode to write my html, css and 
            any other code will be a huge help for me as VSCode color codes and shows mistakes you make so it is a huge help in checking that your code works as intended.</p>

            <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h2>
            <p>On the internet, it can go wrong with legalities. Some form of protection is required in order to remain within guidlines of the law. 
            GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. GDPR applies to any organisation operating within the EU, as well as any organisations outside of the EU which
            offer goods or services to customers or businesses in the EU. GDPR is what is used to standardised data protection laws. It increases privacy and extends data rights
            for EU citizens. These represent issues that need to be considered with all projects as they impact it greatly. Copyright License Agreements exist to allow 
            copyright owners to give access to another person or company to use their copyrighted material in one way or another. When using legal guidlines we must ensure

            <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?</h2>
            <p>I have been using a wide range of IT tools to help me complete this project. For information organization i have been using Trello and updating it whenever i complete a 
            task and start another one. I use Slack to get in contact with anyone if i need to or if i want to send files to others. Apart from that for text editing i use Google 
            Documents and Google Slides which are very helpful as they save your documents to the cloud and you can always access them from anywhere with your email. I used VSCode to write 
            all of my HTML and CSS code as it a very handy and helpful tool for website development. All of these programs and services have been super helpful in helping me stay on top of 
            my project and i have been very satisfied with them and would use them again for future projects.</p>

            <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate</h2>
            <p>For the actual HTML code Visual Studio Code was perfect to create my webpage with as its very easy to use once u have a basic understanding of how it works. GitHub allowed me 
            to upload my project and host it on their Webpage server where i can see how my code looks like to viewers. CodePen was useful in some ways but i mostly used Visual Studio Code 
            to create my code. Trello was a huge help in organising my work schedule and keeping me on track for what i had to do and what i had finished already. Overall all the programs 
            benefited me in one way or another.</p>

            <h2>2.3 </h2>
            <p>LOn the whole, I am happy with how my project turned out, I was able to create something I had envisioned and overall I am proud of what I have learned throughout this course. 
                Some of the parts on the website I would like to expand on and just make it look better in general. This is because it looks way to simple for a website but because of the time 
                restraint, I wasn’t able to put extra work into my project. All in all, I have the basic structure and my content which meets the criteria so I am happy with what I was able to 
                create. Things I would change would be the buttons and background image. Instead of using buttons i could use something like: a href="https://assignment2.io">Visit Assignment 2 /a
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h2>2.4 </h2>
            <p> Alternatively, I could make my buttons always stay at the top of the page even when you are scrolling to allow people to always select what page they want to be on from any point 
                of the page. Something else I want is a background image that looks good both in landscape and in portrait. Because some people might view the webpage using their mobile phone the 
                background image would be stretched to fit the phone size which in turn will decrease quality. On the other hand, if you are designing a webpage background image to look good on 
                mobile phones it would look stretched when viewed on a webpage. To fix this I would have to spend some time messing around with flex which I sadly don't have.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="wrapper">
            <h2>2.5 </h2>
            <p>Overall i was able to meet all of the basic requirements and even squeezed a couple extra lines of CSS and HTML into my page. My page was able to be built for the purpose of showcasing 
                my work using simple navigation and layout practices and i was able to meet all these targets.
