            <h2>1.1 Describe the content and layout for each page</h2>
            <p> So for my website, I will be adding a basic navbar to be able to navigate my 3 pages. 
            For the structure of my webpage, I will have my index as my introduction page where I 
            talk about myself and any information that I don’t need to include in the assignment pages. 
            I will have a box separating each paragraph and make the index page have most of my CSS. Each box 
            and container will have a consistent style so the webpage looks the same throughout. This can include 
            Font Size, Font Type and any CSS I use for individual boxes. Having a consistent theme will make my 
            page look a lot more professional. i will be using containers and wrappers for the content on the 
            page with paragraphs and heading 2's for each of the points i will be talking about</p>

            <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites </h2>
            <p>Copyright is protection on someone’s intellectual creation, be it written or an image (film/photo/drawing) & 
            this extends to a website. Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites as they can restrict what content you 
            are able to publish to the webpage. When using content from another source you would have to get permission 
            from the original author or link to the original with permission from the original author. The content 
            in a webpage was separate copyrights affecting it ranging from literacy copyright for text and code, 
            images would be artistic works and music can be protected by sound recording copyrights. These are all things 
            I will have to consider for my own website.</p>

            <h2>1.6 Describe access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when 
            using web pages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
            <p>For my webpage, because I'm using a lot of colors i would have to take color blind people into consideration as they 
            might have trouble seeing information due to the color design of my webpage. If for example, I had a video or music 
            in the background of my page I would have to take deaf people into consideration as they wouldn't be able to hear any 
            information through sound.
            Vision - Contrast of the colours.
            Hearing - Hearing disabilities.
            Motor skills - Difficulty using a keyboard and mouse.
            Photosensitive seizures - Flashing images.
            Cognitive disabilities - Dementia and dyslexia.</p>
