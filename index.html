            <p>From an early age i have been fascinated by what things you can create using computers. 
                This ranges from webpage design,gaming and uploading original content to pages such as 
                YouTube and Facebook. Due to me being exposed to PC games from an early age i will 
                always have an interest in them and how they work. When i started college i was doing 
                a photography course where i picked more computers skills up regarding image manipulation. 
                I have a decent understand of how to use Photoshop and InDesign to create creative pieces 
                of work or edit them. Recently i completed a Cyber Security course with CodeNation that 
                has given me more IT skills i can use and learn. Because i enjoyed the course so much 
                and i have some spare time on my hands i decided to enrol in the Coding course by CodeNation.
                I run my own artwork focused Facebook page and have been thinking of creating a website for it
                where i could showcase different artwork, sell merchandise and just give more information 
                about myself and my brand. So far im enjoying it quite a bit and this here is my first working
                webpage that will contain my assignments for the course. I plan to use this for my portofolio.
